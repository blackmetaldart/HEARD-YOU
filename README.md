# PROJECT-III
### A SONG-BASED CHAT APPLICATION USING AN REACTJS FRONT-END AND A JAVA/SPRING BOOT BACK-END

This is a project that utilizes ReactJs to construct a front-end that accesses the functionality provided by an API that offers blog-like functionality. Users can make sign-up and view the top songs and view posts created by other users.


### TECHNOLOGIES USED
* [INTELLIJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - An IDE used for the Java
* [POSTGRESQL](https://www.postgresql.org) An object-relational database system used with SQL
* [MAVEN](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management 
* [ATOM](https://atom.io) - A cool text editor used to write the ReactJs files.
* [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com) - A platform for testing and developing APIs
* [REACTJS](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

### APPROACH TAKEN
I started off this application as a collection of microservices. At first, the idea was complex and involved pre-constructed APIs and concepts that I could not build. After mapping out what needed to be done, I stripped away the complexity of the idea into the simplicity of its services. At the very base of the application there are services that I wanted to implement, so I had to make sure that the microservices could function as microservices before implementing real functionality.
