# HEARD-YOU

### A FULL-STACK APPLICATION THAT USES REACTJS ON THE CLIENT-SIDE AND JAVA, THE SPRING FRAMEWORK AND POSTGRESQL ON THE SERVER-SIDE. THIS PROJECT WAS DEPLOYED USING DOCKER AND AMAZON WEB SERVICES.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
* [INTELLIJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - An IDE used to develop the Java back-end application
* [POSTGRESQL](https://www.postgresql.org) An object-relational database system used with SQL
* [MAVEN](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management 
* [ATOM](https://atom.io) - A text editor used to write the ReactJs files
* [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com) - A platform for testing and developing APIs
* [REACTJS](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [DOCKER](https://www.docker.com/) - A container platform to build, manage and secure traditional applications and microservices
* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg) - Deployment
### APPROACH TAKEN
I started off this application as a collection of microservices. At first, the idea was complex and involved pre-constructed APIs and concepts that I could not build. After mapping out what needed to be done, I stripped away the complexity of the idea into the simplicity of its services. At the very base of the application there are services that I wanted to implement, so I had to make sure that the microservices could function as microservices before implementing real functionality.

### MAJOR HURDLES
The major hurdle for me was creating microservices without reference to a monolith. I had to learn how to use Docker and ReactJs. I wasn't sure if anything would work, but I knew what I wanted to make work. The learning opportunity with this was whether or not my assumptions about what makes a functional microservice were correct.
