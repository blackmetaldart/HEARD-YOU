### A SONG-BASED CHAT APPLICATION USING A REACTJS FRONT-END AND A JAVA/SPRING BOOT BACK-END

### DESCRIPTION
This is a project that utilizes ReactJs to construct a front-end that accesses the functionality provided by an API that offers blog-like functionality. Users can make sign-up and view the top songs and view posts created by other users.


### TECHNOLOGIES USED
* [INTELLIJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - An IDE used to develop the Java back-end application
* [POSTGRESQL](https://www.postgresql.org) An object-relational database system used with SQL
* [MAVEN](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management 
* [ATOM](https://atom.io) - A text editor used to write the ReactJs files
* [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com) - A platform for testing and developing APIs
* [REACTJS](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [DOCKER](https://www.docker.com/) - A container platform to build, manage and secure traditional applications and microservices
* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg) - Deployment
### APPROACH TAKEN
I started off this application as a collection of microservices. At first, the idea was complex and involved pre-constructed APIs and concepts that I could not build. After mapping out what needed to be done, I stripped away the complexity of the idea into the simplicity of its services. At the very base of the application there are services that I wanted to implement, so I had to make sure that the microservices could function as microservices before implementing real functionality.

### MAJOR HURDLES
The major hurdle for me was creating microservices without reference to a monolith. I had to learn how to use Docker and ReactJs. I wasn't sure if anything would work, but I knew what I wanted to make work. The learning opportunity with this was whether or not my assumptions about what makes a functional microservice were correct. 

### RECOMMENDED USER STORIES
* AS AN ADMIN I WANT TO UPDATE THE SONG LIST SO THAT USERS ARE ENGAGING WITH NEW CONTENT
* AS A USER I WANT TO SEE A LIST ALL THE SONGS SO THAT I CAN SEE THE SITE'S MAIN CONTENT
* AS A GUEST I WANT TO SEE A LIST OF RECENT POSTS SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THE SITE
