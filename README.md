# HEARD-YOU
> A FULL-STACK APPLICATION THAT USES REACTJS ON THE CLIENT-SIDE AND JAVA, THE SPRING FRAMEWORK AND POSTGRESQL ON THE SERVER-SIDE. THIS PROJECT WAS DEPLOYED USING DOCKER AND AMAZON WEB SERVICES.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
#### CLIENT SIDE
* [REACTJS](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [ATOM](https://atom.io) - A text editor used to write the ReactJs files

#### SERVER END
* [JAVA](https://www.java.com/en/) - A programming language and computing platform
* [SPRING BOOT](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - An open source Java-based framework used to create a micro-service (tutorialspoint.com)
* [POSTGRESQL](https://www.postgresql.org) - An object-relational database system that uses and extends the [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) language
* [MAVEN](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) - A build automation tool for managing the dependencies 
* [INTELLIJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - An IDE used to develop the Java back-end files
* [DOCKER](https://www.docker.com/) - A container platform to build, manage and secure traditional applications and microservices

#### CLIENT <--> SERVER
* [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com) - A platform for testing and developing APIs
* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg) - Deployment

### APPROACH TAKEN
I started off this application as a collection of microservices. At first, the idea was complex and involved pre-constructed APIs and concepts that I could not build. After mapping out what needed to be done, I stripped away the complexity of the idea into the simplicity of its services. At the very base of the application there are services that I wanted to implement, so I had to make sure that the microservices could function as microservices before implementing real functionality.

### MAJOR HURDLES
The major hurdle for me was creating microservices without reference to a monolith. I had to learn how to use Docker and ReactJs. I wasn't sure if anything would work, but I knew what I wanted to make work. The learning opportunity with this was whether or not my assumptions about what makes a functional microservice were correct.
